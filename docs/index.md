# Revolution EDA Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of Revolution EDA! This comprehensive guide is designed to
provide you with all the information you need to effectively use our software for custom
integrated circuit design.

Revolution EDA is a new generation electronic design automation package targeting custom
integrated circuit design. It provides a complete schematic capture, symbol editing, and
physical layout environment with integrated simulation and analysis capabilities through
optional plugins. With a user-friendly interface, Python-based parameter management, and
support for industry-standard formats, Revolution EDA offers a complete solution for
designing and optimizing electronic circuits.

This documentation is organized to take you through the different stages of the design
process, from installation and library setup to creating schematics, symbols, and layouts,
and finally to netlisting and simulation. Each section provides detailed information on the
features and functionalities, along with step-by-step instructions and examples to help you
get started quickly.

Whether you are a student learning IC design or an experienced professional working on
advanced mixed-signal circuits, Revolution EDA offers the flexibility and power you need to
create sophisticated electronic designs. The software is built on modern Python technology (
PySide6) and uses JSON-based file formats for maximum transparency and version control
compatibility.

Because Revolution EDA can work on various operating systems, whether Windows or Linux or MacOS, 
the screenshots in this document are also from various platforms. Revolution EDA unlike other 
legacy electronic design automation systems does not force the user to a certain platform but fits
into their usual workflow.

### [Installation](./installation.md)

Revolution EDA offers multiple installation methods. Whether installing via pip from PyPI,
downloading pre-compiled binaries, or building from source using Poetry, the installation
process is straightforward and well-documented. The software requires Python 3.12 or 3.13
and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

------

### [Main Window](./revedaMainWindow.md)

The Revolution EDA main window is the starting point for all design activities. It provides
access to the library browser, import tools, and application settings through a clean
menu-driven interface. The window features an integrated Python REPL console that allows
direct access to Revolution EDA's internal APIs for automation and scripting. The
application uses a multi-threaded architecture with a configurable thread pool for efficient
background processing.

### [Schematic Editor](./schematicTutorial.md)

The schematic editor is where circuit design begins. It is used to instantiate symbols and
define the nets that connect them. The editor supports hierarchical design, Python-based
instance parameter calculations, automatic symbol generation from schematics, net
highlighting, and instance renumbering. It integrates seamlessly with the netlisting engine
and optional simulation plugins for complete design flow support.

------

### [Symbol Editor](./symbolTutorial.md)

The symbol editor is used to create schematic representations of circuit components and
hierarchical blocks. It supports drawing lines, rectangles, circles, arcs, and polygons,
along with pins and labels. Symbols can have both common attributes shared across all
instances and instance-specific parameters. The editor supports three types of labels:
Normal (annotations), NLP labels (Natural Language Parameter labels with simple evaluation),
and Python labels (dynamic calculation based on other parameters).

------

### [Layout Editor](./layoutTutorial.md)

The layout editor is a full-featured tool for physical layout design of custom integrated
circuits. It supports hierarchical layout design with rectangles, paths, polygons, pins,
labels, vias, and Python-based parametric cells (pcells). The editor includes a Layer
Selection Window (LSW) for layer visibility and selectability management, rulers for
measurement, and GDS import/export capabilities.

------

### [Config Editor](./configEditor.md)

The config view editor provides advanced control over the netlisting process, similar to
commercial EDA tools. Using a config view, designers can specify exactly which cellview (
schematic, veriloga, spice, or symbol) should be used for each cell in the design hierarchy.
This is essential for large hierarchical designs where different abstraction levels are
needed for different blocks. The config editor displays all cells in the hierarchy and
allows per-cell view selection with customizable switch and stop view lists.
